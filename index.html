        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. The game features an expansive world with diverse landscapes, elemental combat systems, and a gacha-based character acquisition system. Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god (archon). </p>
        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>Aether and Lumine, a pair of twins who travel across different worlds, land in Teyvat. Witnessing the destruction of Khaenri'ah upon their arrival, the two attempt to flee, but they soon find their path blocked by a mysterious god who calls herself the "Sustainer of Heavenly Principles". She separates the twins, sealing the playable character away for five hundred years. When the sealed sibling, now called "The Traveler", wakes up, they meet a small fairy-like being named Paimon, who becomes their companion and travel guide. The two set off on a journey across Teyvat to gather information about their lost twin from each nation's ruling Archon.</p>
